Movie Hub is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The purpose of this project is to provide users with an easy way to browse, search, and manage movie information through a simple and responsive interface. The frontend is built with React to create a dynamic user experience, while the backend uses Node.js and Express.js to handle API requests and database operations. MongoDB is used to store movie details such as title, genre, release year, and description. This project demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies, REST API development, and database connectivity, making it a good example of a full-stack web application.
